Sticker Guy just dropped a fresh batch of inspiration-themed stickers — story-driven digital items that hold fragments of the stickers. Scan to unlock. Collect to remember. Some are rare, some are raw, all part of the bigger story.

New collectors will uncover hidden messages and story within the “Three Things” series, while returning holders may recognize echoes from past scans — now reborn in new form.
